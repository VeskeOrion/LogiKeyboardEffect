# LogiKeyboardEffect
My very own, very specific program for illuminating the Logitech G810 Orion Spectrum keyboard keys.

Uses Windows-specific code for timing and input (using the raw input API) to determine keyboard keypresses, and then lights up the keyboard keys in cool and funky ways.

To compile this, you will need the Logitech G Developer LED SDK for its library files and header files, which I originally found at the link https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/developers. However, I imagine this link could change or die at any point.
